This repository contains code for the Phillies Baseball R&D's questionnaire. The language used is Julia, and for convenience the code is published in a Jupyter notebook. The easiest way to access the code is to launch the repo with Binder via the badge above. If you want to run the notebook locally, the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files are included to ensure reproducibility.
